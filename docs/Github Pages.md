## Who can use this feature?

GitHub Pages is available in public repositories with GitHub Free and GitHub Free for organizations, and in public and private repositories with GitHub Pro, GitHub Team, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server. For more information, see "[GitHubâ€™s plans](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/learning-about-github/githubs-plans)."

All GitHub Pages builds will use GitHub Actions from June 30, 2024. No other changes are required but GitHub Actions must be enabled in your repository for builds to continue. For more information on enabling GitHub Actions, see "[Managing GitHub Actions settings for a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository)."
